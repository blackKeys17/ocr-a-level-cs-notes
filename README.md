# OCR A level CS notes
- These are my revision notes (which are mainly copied from notes which I took throughout y12-13)
- I also took a lot of stuff from [PMT](https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/computer-science-revision/a-level-ocr/), [SaveMyExams](https://www.savemyexams.com/a-level/computer-science/ocr/17/revision-notes/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- They should cover every topic which comes up in the OCR A level syllabus
