## Section (a)

### Characteristics of a network
- A network is **2 or more computers** connected together, which are able to **transmit data** between each other
- Networks may also contain **shared peripherals**, for example, an office network may contain printers
- The main purpose of networks is to **share data and resources** and for **communication and collaboration**
- In some cases, setting up a network allows for **security and backup to be centralised**, which makes it easier to manage, but more on this is covered later
- Networks can be categorised in different ways

#### LANs
- LAN stands for **local area network**
- This is a network which is spread over a **small geographic area**
- For example, this could be a home network or school network

#### WANs
- WAN stands for **wide area network**
- This is a network which is spread over a **large geographic area**
- The **internet** is a good example of a WAN
- Most of the **hardware** in a WAN will be owned by **third parties**

### Protocols
- A **set of rules** which defines how 2 computers **communicate** with each other
- This ensures all devices **follow the same rules** when communicating with each other, so they can **interpret signals in the same way**
- There are a lot of commonly used protocols, which are for different purposes

#### HTTP
- Stands for **hypertext transfer protocol**
- Used to **transfer web content**
- Today, **HTTPS** *(s for secure)* is more commonly used

#### TCP/IP
- This stands for **transmission control protocol/internet protocol
- This is a **networking protocol** used to route packets through a network and verify that they have been transmitted
- More on this *will be covered later*

#### FTP
- This stands for **file transfer protocol
- This is used for **transferring files over a network**
- Can also provide **authentication** and **manage directories**

#### POP3
- Stands for **post office protocol 3**
- Allows for **emails** to be downloaded from a mail server onto a device
- This means that the emails to be viewed even when offline

## Section (b)

### The internet structure

#### TCP/IP stack
- This stack contains **4 protocols** which are used to **transmit packets/data over a network**
- The sender will move **down** these 4 layers when encapsulating the data to be sent
- The recipient moves **up** these 4 layers when removing them 1 by 1 until getting back to the application layer, where the data is presented in the format it was requested in

##### Application layer
- Interacts directly with **software applications**, which might be **web browsers** or **email clients**
- Specifies the **protocol which should be used** and encapsulates the data in a suitable format for that protocol

##### Transport layer
- Responsible for establishing an **end-to-end** connection between the source and recipient
- Data gets split into **packets**, which each get labelled with a **packet header**
- The packet header contains a **packet number** so it is easy to **reorder packets** once they arrive at the destination
- Any **lost** packets will be **re-transmitted**
- The packet header also includes a **port number**

##### Internet layer
- This layer is responsible for adding the source and destination **IP addresses**
- **Routers** are the hardware which operate on this layer and allow for packets to be forwarded according to their IP address

##### Link layer
- Prepares all of the data which has been sent down from the internet layer to be transmitted over a **physical network**
- This means that the data might be translated into **electrical, optical or wireless signals** which get sent to the recipient

##### Why do all of this?
- More **modular**, so easier to design and identify where errors are when there are multiple layers
- Updates can be made to a layer without affecting other layers, which makes **updates** easier
- Allows for **abstraction**, in the sense that a specific layer can be optimised without needing to worry about the effect that the optimisation may have on other layers

#### DNS
- DNS stands for **domain name system**
- It is used to translate **human-readable** domain names *(for example, things like google.com)* into **IP addresses**, which are a lot more difficult to remember
- Smaller domains are separated from larger domains by a **full stop** in this system
- The largest domain is called a **top level domain (TLD)**, which is the **rightmost** part of a domain name

##### Fetching a webpage
- When a URL is entered into a web browser (which contains the domain name of the IP address), a **local cache** is usually checked first to see if the IP address is already known
- If not, a query is sent to a **DNS server**
- If an IP address still isn't found, the DNS server can send a request to a **root server**, which sends a request to an appropriate **TLD server**
- Once the IP address is known, an **HTTP(S)** request can be sent to the IP address and the browser can render the data which it receives

#### Packet switching
- Data is communicated across a network through **packets**
- This means that the data **can be sent down multiple routes**

##### Packets
- Packets are **segments of data** which also contain additional information about the data 

###### Packet header
- Packets contain a **header**, which contains:
	- Protocol being used - added at **application layer**
	- Packet number - added at **transport layer**, which allows for the original message to be reordered by the recipient
	- **IP addresses** for the sender and recipient - these are added at the **internet layer** of TCP/IP
	- Time to live - tells the packet to **expire** after a certain time

###### Payload
- The **payload** contains the **raw data** which gets transmitted

###### Trailer
- This contains a **checksum** which is used for **error detection**

##### Advantages
- Multiple routes which data can travel through, so **resistant** to portions of a network failing
- Doesn't waste as much bandwidth as **circuit switching**
- Error checks means that data should always arrive intact

##### Disadvantages
- Packets **don't necessarily arrive in order**, so **additional time** is need to **reorder packets** at the recipient
- All of the packets need to arrive before reconstruction

#### Circuit switching
- A **direct link** is established between 2 devices which are communicating
- This is maintained **throughout the entire conversation** or transfer of data between the 2 devices

##### Advantages
- Data arrives **in order**, so **less time** is needed to **reconstruct** it
- Decreases **delay**, as data is transmitted down a direct path

##### Disadvantages
- When no data is being sent, the routes which have been used to establish the link are **wasted**
- This means that **other devices are unable to use these sections of a network**
- Potential **security concern** - it is possible to intercept all of the transmitted data at once
