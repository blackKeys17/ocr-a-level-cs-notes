### Relational databases

#### Some key terms

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Database            | Persistent, organised store of data                                                                                                                                                              |
| Flat file           | Storing all of the data in 1 file/table, which usually isn't a good idea if there is a lot of data...                                                                                            |
| Entity              | Something which data can be collected about                                                                                                                                                      |
| Attribute           | Characteristic/trait of an entity, can be represented as columns in a table for that entity                                                                                                      |
| Table               | In a database - each table represents an entity, each column represents an attribute. Fixed number of columns, variable rows                                                                     |
| Field               | A column in a table                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Record              | A row in a table                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Relational database | Contains multiple tables of data which are related to each other through special key fields<br>This is done to reduce redundancy, and making the data easier to maintain, search and interrogate |

#### Advantages
- Less **redundancy**, so more **space efficient**
- Easier to **query** and **maintain**
- Captures **relationships between entities**

#### Primary key
- A **unique identifier** for each **record** in a table
- **Underlined** to show that it is a primary key
- A lot of times this is an ID

#### Foreign key
- An attribute which **links 2 tables together**
- Exists as a **primary key** in 1 table, and as a **foreign key** in another

#### Secondary key
- Makes it **easier to search** a database
- For example, if storing information about patients at a hospital, it is *much easier* to remember and search by surnames instead of having to memorise a long ID number for each patient

### Modelling entity relationships
- These are how entities are related to each other in the real world, and influence how we represent them as tables in a relational database

#### One to one
- Each item in a table can be linked to **1 other item in another table**
- For example, each husband is linked to 1 wife, and vice versa

#### One to many
- One item in a table can be linked to **multiple other items in the other table**, but not the other way around
- For example, a mother may have multiple children, but each child has exactly 1 mother

#### Many to many
- One item in a table can be linked to **multiple other items in the other table** and vice versa
- For example, a university course can have multiple students, and a student can take part in multiple courses
- To deal with these, we can create a **junction/associative** table which links these tables together
- This new table will use a **compound primary key** which is made up of both the primary keys in each of other 2 tables
- For example, for students and courses, creating a new table called *registrations* (I couldn't think of anything better) would be a reasonable solution

## Section (b)

### Capturing data

#### Optical mark recognition (OMR)
- Can detect **marked areas** on paper with a machine
- Good for exams and surveys
- Fully automates the marking process, making it a lot faster and cheaper (overall)

#### Optical character recognition
- Can **read handwritten digits/text**
- Good for making digital copies of documents
- Can be **error-prone**, struggles to deal with *bad handwriting* 

#### Sensors
- These can be used to collect data
- More in [[1.1.3 Input, Output and Storage#Sensors|here]]

### Managing data
- This is usually done by creating a **database**
- Using a **database manipulation language** such as **SQL** allows for:
	- **Creating** new data
	- **Reading** in data
	- **Updating** existing data
	- **Deleting** data

### Exchanging data

#### CSV
- Stands for **comma separated values**
- **Simple** format for exchanging data
- Stored as plaintext, separating values with commas
- **Wide support**, also **easy to parse** once received

#### JSON
- Stands for **JavaScript Object Notation
- Fairly lightweight format
- Uses **key-value pairs**

#### EDI
- Stands for **electronic data interchange
- **Standardised** electronic communication method used to transfer documents and data between businesses
- **Reduces paper usage**

#### APIs
- Stands for **application programming interface**
- A set of **protocols** which allow for different software to communicate with each other
- Can allow for data exchange between different platforms

## Section (c)
### Normalisation
- **Restructuring** a database to make it more **space efficient** and **easier to maintain and query**
- This should also help improve the speed of any queries and operations which take place on the database

#### 1st normal form (1NF)
- Each table has a **primary key** which acts as a unique identifier for each record (this is actually a requirement of **UNF**)
- The entries in the database are **atomic**
- This means that no entry can contain **more than 1 value**
- For example, if a song has 2 artists, 1NF doesn't allow for the 2 artists to both be placed in the same entry

#### 2nd normal form (2NF)
- First requires the database to **already be in 1NF**
- Additionally, 2NF doesn't allow any **partial dependencies**
- This is an attribute which is **completely dependent** on only **part** of a compound key
- This is relevant in **junction tables**
- For example, consider a courses table which has a compound key made up of *studentID* and *courseID*
- Consider an attribute *courseFee*
- This is completely dependent on *courseID* but not necessarily on *studentID*, so this would be a partial dependency
- To resolve this, **create a new table**

#### 3rd normal form (3NF)
- First requires the database to **already be in 2NF**
- Additionally, 3NF doesn't allow any **transitive dependencies**
- This is where an attribute is **dependent on a non-primary key**
- For example, in a *song* table which has *genre* as an attribute, consider the attribute *genre abbreviation*
- This is dependent on *genre*, which is not the primary key (and *genre* is dependent on *song*)
- This is a transitive dependency, so the table is not in 3NF
- Again, to solve this, **create a new table**

## Section (d)

### SQL
- Stands for **structured query language**
- It is a **declarative language**, which is used for **manipulating databases**
- In general, any SQL which can **modify** the database should be handled **very carefully**
- The examples below are from an example which I worked through in school, which uses a database of songs and artists

#### Reading data

##### SELECT, FROM
- Collect **fields** from a given **table**
- Suppose we wanted to get the fields SongTitle and Length from the Song table
- This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT SongTitle, Length
FROM Song;
```

- You can also use an asterisk * to select *every* field

```
SELECT *
FROM Song
```

##### WHERE
- **WHERE** can be used to **filter** entries by a certain condition
- Suppose we only want songs which are at least 180 minutes long
- This can be achieved with the following query:

```
SELECT SongTitle, Length
FROM Song
WHERE Length >= 180;
```

- More complex conditions can be implemented by using keywords such as **AND**, **OR** and **MOD**, which behave similarly as in other programming languages
- **LIKE** can be used for **pattern matching** conditions
- For example, suppose we only want songs which start with the letter 'a'
- This can be done with the following query:

```
SELECT SongTitle, Length
FROM Song
WHERE Song LIKE '[aA]*';
```

##### ORDER BY
- **ORDER BY** allows for the entries to be ordered according to a particular field
- **DESC** can be used to reverse the order
- ORDER BY can be used multiple times to sort the data using a field and resolving order in clashes by using another field with **lower priority**
- For example, to display the songs in **reverse alphabetical order**, the following query would work:

```
SELECT SongTitle, Length
FROM Song
ORDER BY SongTitle DESC;
```

##### INNER JOIN (just JOIN is fine for A-level)
- This can be used to get fields from **multiple tables**
- 2 tables can be inner joined **ON** a common foreign key which they share
- When inner joining, you will additionally need to specify which table each field came from
- For example, to get song titles and chart peaks (which is in a separate table), and inner join is needed:

```
SELECT Song.SongTitle, Release.Chartpeak
FROM Song INNER JOIN Release
ON Song.SingleID = Release.SingleID;
```

##### Nested SELECT
- This can also be used for queries involving **multiple tables**
- *Roughly speaking*, this can be thought of as making a query to get information from 1 table, then using this information as a filtering condition for another query
- For example, to find all songs which didn't reach number 1 on the charts, we can use the following:

```
SELECT SongTitle
FROM Song
WHERE SingleID in (
	SELECT SingleID
	FROM Release
	WHERE ChartPeak > 1
);
```

#### Updating data

##### ALTER
- Can be used to change the structure of the **fields/columns** in a table (as opposed to INSERT which adds new **records**)
- This has *never come up* in A-level

##### UPDATE SET
- Used to modify a record in a database, use **UPDATE** and **SET**
- Only need to specify the **fields** which are to be updated and which **values** which they are updated to
- Should nearly always be used with a **WHERE** to specify which records get updated
- For example, to update the first customer in a table with new personal information, the following query can be used:

```
UPDATE Customers  
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'  
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

#### Creating data

##### INSERT INTO
- Adds a new record into a table
- Here, unless you have values for every field for the record, you will need to **specify the fields** which the record has data to be inserted for and the **values** which are to be inserted, which are all **surrounded by parentheses**
- For example, using a database with customer information, to insert a new customer, the following query can be used:

```
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)  
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
```

- Primary keys with an ID will **automatically increment** so it isn't actually needed here (but probably safer to put it in for A-level just in case) 

#### Deleting data

##### DELETE FROM
- Used to **delete** a **record** from a table
- Use **WHERE** to specify which records get deleted
- The syntax is as follows:

```
DELETE FROM TableName
WHERE column = value;
```

##### DROP TABLE
- Used to **delete an entire table**
- *Obviously* should be used very carefully
- To delete the Songs table, the following query can be used:

```
DROP TABLE Songs;
```

## Section (e)

### Referential integrity
- Every **foreign key** must reference a **valid and existing primary key** from its parent table
- This rule is enforced to **ensure consistency**
- For example, consider a database which stores customers and restaurant reviews in 2 tables, 1 for customers and another for reviews which has a foreign key linked to primary key of the customer table
- Suppose we want to delete a customer, then by **referential integrity**, we will also need to delete all of their reviews (otherwise they will not be linked to an existing primary key any more)

## Section (f)

### Transactions
- A **transaction** is a **single operation executed on data**

### ACID
- **ACID** refers to 4 properties which a transaction **must satisfy**

#### Atomicity
- *Not to be confused with atomic entries in a database for 1NF*
- All changes to data are performed **as if they are a single operation**
- If a transaction involves multiple steps, either **they are all performed** or **none of them are performed**

#### Consistency
- Ensures that the database is in a **valid state** after a transaction
- For example, in a bank database, suppose we want to transfer money from one account into another
- To ensure that the transaction is consistent, the total value of the funds in both accounts can't change

#### Isolation
- Any **simultaneous transactions** should lead to the same result as if they were executed **one after another**
- This also means that when a transaction is running, it does so in **isolation**, so the data it is operating on **isn't accessible to other transactions at the same time**

#### Durability
- Changes to data due to a transactions **persist after they have been executed**
- This means saving it to some **secondary storage device** in case there is a power cut or anything which could cause the result to be lost

### Record locking
- **Preventing simultaneous access to the same records**, in order to **prevent inconsistencies**
- On a database with **multiple users**, when a user is editing a record, it gets **locked** so no other users can touch it
- However, concurrent access to a database can be useful for teams, which record locking prevents
- Record locking can also cause **deadlocks**, which can be caused when 2 users are swapping the records they are working on
- One way to deal with this is **timestamp ordering**, where users can be notified about the **last time the record they are using was updated** and whether **they are working on the most up-to-date version of the database**

### Redundancy
- **Backing up** the database, usually in different physical locations to **reduce the chance of completely losing the database** even in a catastrophic scenario
