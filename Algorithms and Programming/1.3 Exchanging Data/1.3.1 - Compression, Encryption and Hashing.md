## Section (a)

### Compression
- **Reduces** the storage space required by a file
- Can store **more files** with the same amount of storage
- Most important for **transferring files**
- Compressing files makes them smaller, which makes transfer a lot faster
- For example, when streaming a video, without compression, there will likely be a lot of **buffering** because the video can't be downloaded fast enough

### Lossless compression
- This type of compression **preserves** all of the original data, so it can be **perfectly reconstructed**
- This is good for files which can't afford drops in quality
- This could include:
	- Text files
	- Music for large events, which require very high quality

### Lossy compression
- This type of compression may **lose** some data from the original file (hence the name)
- This usually allows for the compressed file to be **even smaller than a file using lossless compression**
- This is used for files which don't need to be perfectly preserve
- This could include:
	- Images and videos
	- Music

## Section (b)

### Run length encoding
- This is a method of **lossless compression**
- Replaces **runs of consecutive characters** with the character, followed by how many appearances it made
- For example, **AAAAAABBBBBCCC** could be represented as **A6B5C3**
- This requires on lots of consecutive characters in the data to be **effective**
- RLE could potentially *increase* file sizes if the file has hardly got any consecutive characters 

### Dictionary encoding
- Frequently used words may be stored in a dictionary and each occurrence of the word in the file can be replaced with its corresponding index in the dictionary
- The data needs to be transferred **with the dictionary**
- LZW compression is an even better way of doing this

## Section (c)

### Encryption
- Sometimes we need to make sure that confidential data **can't be viewed by unintended recipients**, but **can be understood by the intended recipient(s)**
- Encryption ensures that even if they manage to get hold of the data we wanted to transfer, it is **unreadable**

#### Symmetric encryption
- Both sender and receiver use the same **private key**
- This key is used for both **encrypting** and **decrypting** data
- The key must be distributed to the receiver, but it can get **intercepted** along the way
- Anybody who has this private key can intercept communications between the 2 parties
- This is a **major disadvantage**
- However, this method of encryption is **easier** and **safer**, so it is suitable for anything which isn't required to be completely secure

#### Asymmetric encryption
- **2 keys** are use: a **private key** and a **public key** 
- The public key can be published online by the receiver for anybody to use
- Anybody who wants to send a message to the receiver can encrypt their message with the receiver's public key
- The receiver has a **private key** which they can use to decrypt the message
- It is **very difficult** to reverse engineer the private key, even when knowing what the public key
- This is a big advantage of asymmetric encryption - it is much more **secure**
- However, it is more computationally intensive and takes longer to do, so it is usually only used for **secure** transactions or communications

## Section (d)

### Hashing
- A hashing algorithm is a **function** which transforms input text into a **fixed size value**, which is called a **hash**
- This function is designed to be **one-way** - it is **nearly impossible** to recover the original plaintext from a hash
- This is different from encryption, which is **two-way** - if you know the key, you have the ability to both **encrypt** and **decrypt** text

#### Properties of a good hashing function
- Low chance of **collisions** - this is where the same input
- Can be **computed quickly**
- Provides a **reasonably small output** - for example, a common hashing algorithm is SHA256, which has 256 bit outputs

### Uses

#### Storing passwords
- It is a good idea to store **passwords** as hashes
- To verify a password a user has entered, it can be hashed and compared to a stored hash in a database
- If an attacker gains access to a database with user info, they will only be able to access the hashes
- The hash is irreversible, so they won't be able to get the original passwords

#### Checking file integrity
- When downloading a file, sometimes the provider also gives a hash of the file contents
- By hashing the downloaded file and comparing the 2 hashes, it is easy to verify whether anything has been transmitted incorrectly

#### Hash tables
- Hash tables can **lookup data** in constant time
- This is a massive improvement compared to a simpler data structure like an array, which averages **linear time** lookups
- These also allow for any type of input to be used as a key for the lookup

- A hash table is **built on top of an array**
- When a new key value pair is added, the key is **hashed** into an index (and probably modded with the length of the array to fit the index into a valid range)
- The new value is placed in the hashed index

##### Dealing with collisions
- Unfortunately, there might be collisions, where multiple keys get hashed to the same index
- There are 2 methods to deal with collisions:

###### Chaining
- The entry in the array can be treated as the head of a linked list
- New items which collide can be added to the end of the linked list instead
- If this is done too often, the constant time lookup advantage of the has table will slowly be lost as the time taken to look up an item in a linked list scales linearly with its length
 
###### Linear probing
- If there is a collision, can instead scan down the array to look for the next available spot
- Insert the new value into the next empty spot in the array
- Again, if this is done too often the hash table starts to lose its advantage against an array
