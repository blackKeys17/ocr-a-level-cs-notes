## Section (a)

### Programming methodologies
- There are many different ways to develop software
- Most of these methods have the following stages...

### Stages in software development lifecycles (SDLCs)

#### Analysis
- **Stakeholders** state what they need from the product
- **Requirements** are **clearly defined** in this stage
	- Strengths/weaknesses of current solutions are probably going to be analysed in this stage
- This stage could also include any **research**

#### Design
- Produce a detailed *outline* of the system which is going to be built
- There are lots of things to consider:
	- **Inputs** - How are they taken? How are they handled? Are they validated?
	- **Outputs** - How is it handled?
	- **Security** - Access levels? Encryption?
	- **Hardware** - Needs to be set up?
	- **UI** - Accessibility, navigation?

#### Development
- Writing the code 
- Might involve decomposing the problem to get different teams of people working on it

#### Testing
- Ensuring the programs work as expected
- There are many different methods for testing:

##### Alpha testing
- Carried out by the software development team
- Bugs can be identified and fixed

##### Beta testing
- Carried out by a small group of end users
- Feedback from users is used

##### White box testing
- Carried out by the software development team
- Testing is based on the **internal structure** of the program, so the tester **has access** to the source code
- Can run through all possible paths determined by the control flow of the system

##### Black box testing
- Tester does not get access to the source code
- The tester only gets the **expected behaviour** of the program
- It only tests for inputs and expected outputs

#### Implementation
- Installing the software onto the users' systems

#### Evaluation
- Performance of the software is **evaluated against** the requirements defined in the evaluation stage
- Different criteria may be considered:
	- Robustness
	- Maintainability
	- Performance

#### Maintenance
- Software **updates** for fixing **bugs** and **security issues**
- These may be flagged up by end users

### Types of SDLCs

#### Waterfall
- Stages are completed **in sequence**
- This means that once 1 stage has been completed, the project **moves on to the next stage without skipping any stage**
- If a stage is returned to, all of the intermediate stages will need to be **completed again**

##### Strengths
- Good for projects with **fixed requirements**
	- Building a car is a good example
- **Simpler** to manage
- **Well-defined targets** at each stage
- Easier to manage **timescale**

##### Weaknesses
- Lack of **flexibility**, so can't adapt well to **changing requirements**
- **User input/feedback** can't be used as effectively

#### Spiral
- Main focus is **risk management**
- It is an **iterative** approach
- 4 key stages:
	- **Analyse** system requirements
	- Identify and mitigate **risk**
	- Development, testing, implementation
	- Evaluating for next iteration
- Project is **terminated** if there is **too much risk**

##### Strengths
- Focus on risk **reduces chance of project failing**
- If the project fails, it is likely to be terminated early, which **reduces costs**
- Iterative, so is able to adapt to changing requirements or **new risks**

##### Weaknesses
- High cost - analysing sources of risk is **expensive**
- Risk analysis is a **specialised skill**
- For this reason, spiral development is generally better suited towards **larger, risk-intensive projects**

#### Agile methodologies
- Refers to a **collection** of methodologies
- They aim to **improve the flexibility** of the software development process, which allows it to **adapt to changing user requirements**
- Analysis and design might be **done together** to save time
- Highly **iterative**, so **prototypes** are constantly being developed, reviewed and improved in a cycle
- **Less focus on documentation**, more focus on client satisfaction

#### Extreme programming (XP)
- **Agile** model
- Main focus is on **code quality**, techniques used in XP are all done with this aim
- Main techniques include:
	- **Pair programming** - 2 programmers work on the same code so it is easier to identify mistakes
	- Multiple users working on 1 file - speeds up development process
	- **Limited working time** every week (usually 40 hours) - programmers won't be as tired so should be able to produce higher quality codeteam
	- **Teamwork**, **communication** and **client feedback** are very important
- Very iterative, so **harder to produce documentation**

##### Strengths
- High quality code
- Very adaptable to user requirements

##### Weaknesses
- High cost - programmers need to be paid more
- Teamwork is very important, so lack of communication can seriously damage a project

#### Rapid application development (RAD)
- Focus on **rapid prototyping**, or even creating **partially functioning prototypes** which are continuously built upon
- User initially defines what they want, then an initial prototype is built
- User feedback is used to guide the development of the next prototype
- Unalike XP, RAD doesn't prioritise code quality

##### Strengths
- User involvement
- End product is more likely to **match the user requirements**
- Problems with a solution are likely to be discovered early on
- **Fast** development - projects with short time frames may benefit from this approach

##### Weaknesses
- **Regular contact with client** needed
- **Code quality** may be worse
- Poor documentation quality

## Section (b)
- Already covered - strengths and weaknesses of each of the above approaches

## Section (c)

### Writing and following algorithms
- Covered more in:
	- [[2.1.1 - Thinking Abstractly]]
	- [[2.1.2 - Thinking Ahead]]
	- [[2.1.3 - Thinking Procedurally]]
	- [[2.1.4 - Thinking Logically]]
	- [[2.1.5 - Thinking Concurrently]]

- **Algorithms** are a set of instructions used to solve a problem
- They can be translated into code and run on a machine

#### Properties of a good algorithm
- **Clearly defined inputs** - valid inputs, invalid inputs?
- **Unambiguous** - instructions should be defined very clearly
- **Must always produce an output** for any valid input
- **Must terminate** after a finite number of steps

- *Should* be well-documented for reference
- *Should* be well-commented so other people can understand it easily
