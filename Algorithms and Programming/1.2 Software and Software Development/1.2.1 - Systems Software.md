## Section (a)

### Operating systems
- A collection of **programs** which work together to provide and **interface** between a **computer** and **user**
- Allow for a user to communicate with **hardware**

#### Popular operating systems
- Windows - most commonly used
- Linux / UNIX - used a lot by developers and in servers
- iOS - Apple OS for mobile devices
- Android
- Mac OS
- *Temple OS*

#### Requirements of an OS

##### Process management
- Programs and I/O devices **compete** for uses of resources
- The OS needs to **manage** which programs get access to which resources
- This can be done with [[#Scheduling|scheduling]]

##### Handling interrupts
- There are some **high-priority** processes, such as user inputs, which need to be **prioritised over other tasks**
- The OS needs to be able to handle [[#Interrupts|interrupts]]

##### Managing memory
- The OS needs to keep track of which parts of memory have been **allocated** and are being **used**
- This is important as programs can't **interfere** with each other's memory
- This is covered further in [[#Memory management|memory management]]

##### Input / Output
- This is done by using [[#Drivers|device drivers]]

##### Providing a user interface (UI)
- Lots of operating systems have a very interactive UI

## Section (b)

### Memory management
- Memory must be **shared** between multiple programs/applications
- Different programs can't share the same memory location, that would be a disaster
- As programs are loaded in and out of memory, it becomes increasingly **fragmented**, so sometimes files will need to be split into **discontiguous** chunks
- Main memory is often not enough to store everything at once
- There are 3 ways covered at a-level in which this is done, which are:
	- **Paging**
	- **Segmentation**
	- **Virtual memory**
- Note that these techniques are usually done together

#### Paging
- Memory is split into **equal-sized** chunks called **pages**
- Programs/files are split into chunks which are the **same size** as the pages, so they can be directly assigned to a page
- Pages can be easily swapped in and out of memory
- A **page table** is required to show what each page is holding

#### Segmentation
- Memory is instead split into **variable length chunks** called **segments**
- This is done in a way which respects the **structure** and *flow* of programs
- Usually, *(as an example)*, structures like subroutines are bundled into a segment
- A **segment table** is needed to store start point and size of each segment

#### Virtual memory
- Sometimes, there isn't **enough space** in RAM to store all of the programs being run
- **Secondary storage** can be used as a *substitute* for RAM to hold **pages** which aren't currently being used
- This frees up space for other programs in RAM
- This is known as **virtual memory**

##### Disk thrashing
- Sometimes, if virtual memory gets too full, pages will get **swapped between RAM and secondary storage** very frequently
- More time is spent doing the swapping than actually running the program, which could cause a computer to freeze
- This is known as **disk thrashing**

## Section (c)

### Interrupts
- Interrupts are **signals** sent to the processor by software/hardware to indicate that they need the attention of the processor
- They need to be dealt with appropriately depending on their  **urgency**
- Interrupts are stored in an **interrupt queue**

### How are they handled?
- In the **FDE cycle**, the processor checks for interrupts **after the execute stage**
- If the interrupt has high enough priority:
	- State of current job is saved
	- This means that current values held in registers are transferred to a **stack** in a data structure called a **process control block**
	- Interrupt is serviced by loading the appropriate **interrupt service routine (ISR)** into RAM
	- A **flag** is set to signal that the ISR has begun
	- When the interrupt has been serviced, the flag gets reset
	- The **interrupt queue** is checked for higher priority interrupts
	- This process is repeated until all of the interrupts have been serviced
- After all of this, the contents of the registers are restored by copying them back in from the stack

## Section (d)
- *I'm using the words program, process and job interchangeably here, I think it's fine?*

### Scheduling
- Programs and I/O devices are competing for use of the CPU
- The resources need to be shared properly so processes are not *starved* for processor time
- The job of deciding which programs get processor time and swapping programs in and out of the CPU is the job of the **scheduler**, which use **scheduling algorithms**
- Processes are stored in a **queue**, but the choice of which order to run the programs in still needs to be decided

### Scheduling algorithms
- These can be divided into 2 categories...

#### Pre-emptive
- Processes can be stopped before completion
##### Examples
- MLFQ
- SRT
- RR

#### Non pre-emptive
- Jobs run until completion
##### Examples
- FCFS
- SJF

#### Round robin
- Round robin is usually combined with another algorithm
- **Pre-emptive**
- Each job is **allocated a slice** of processor time
- After its slice is over, it gets **swapped out**
- Next job in the queue is loaded in
- Current job gets pushed to the back of the queue

#### Shortest job first
- **Non pre-emptive**
- Sorts jobs in ascending order based on an **approximation** of how long it will take to execute
- This means that once a job is completed, the next one to start executing takes the shortest expected time
- This has a **drawback**: long jobs may end up never running

#### Shortest remaining time
- **Pre-emptive**
- Ready queue is sorted by **expected remaining time**
- Favours short jobs even more than **SJF**, which could be a big drawback

#### Multi-level feedback queues
- **Pre-emptive**
- Maintain **multiple** queues with different priority levels
- When a job is moved out of the processor, it is moved back into one of these queues
- If a job has been at a low priority level of the MLFQ for a while, it can be **promoted** back up to a higher level

## Section (e)

### Types of operating system

#### Distributed OS
- Used in **servers**
- Able to **coordinate** and **spread** the processing of a single job across **multiple** computers
- Can be used for **task distribution** and **load balancing**

#### Multi-tasking OS
- A single processor *appears* to be able to do **more than 1** task **simultaneously**
- This is achieved through **scheduling**

#### Multi-user OS
- Some systems have a very powerful central computer called a **mainframe**
- Supports **multiple users**, which includes features for **security** and **privacy**
- Needs to efficiently manage **resource allocation**, which is done through **scheduling algorithms**
- This prevents **processor starvation**, which is when a process is not given enough processor time to be completed

#### Embedded OS
- Built to perform a **specific task**
- Much more limited **functionality**
- Typically have **lower power consumption**
- Applications are typically stored in **ROM**, which is fine as:
	- They probably *don't* need to be updated
	- ROM has a **faster** access speed than **secondary storage**

#### Real time OS
- Must respond within a **guaranteed time frame** to inputs
- Generally have **limited input**
- Must have a **failsafe**, so hardware **redundancy** (more sensors for example) is good 
- Failsafes are features which attempt to **minimise further damage** in the event of failure of some feature
- Examples:
	- Nuclear power plant
	- Self-driving cars
	- Industrial plant
	- On a plane

## Section (f)

### BIOS
- BIOS stands for **basic input output system**
- It is the **first** program which runs when a computer is switched on
- BIOS:
	- **Initialises** and **tests** hardware in a **POST (power on self test)** 
	- This includes testing whether **memory** is accessible and scanning **buses** 
	- Loads the **OS kernel** into **RAM**

## Section (g)

### Drivers
- Device drivers are **software** which allow the **OS** to control **peripherals**
- Note that drivers are **specific** to an **OS**
- There can be drivers for:
	- Printers
	- Displays
	- Keyboards
	- Mouses
- A lot of device drivers are *built in* to the OS
- Also look at [[1.1.3 Input, Output and Storage#Some terminology|this bit on drivers]]

## Section (h)

### Virtual machines (VMs)
- A **software implementation** of a computer system

#### Intermediate code
- Code which is *halfway* between **machine code** and **object code**
- **Independent of processor architecture**, so this code can be used across different machines and operating systems
- This means that intermediate code which is developed and compiled on 1 system can be run on **any other system**
- However, this would cause **slower** execution time
- VMs can be used to execute intermediate code
- A good example of this is the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**

#### Sandboxing
- Good for testing malware/anti-malware
- Malware will **only damage the VM**, so if it actually gets infected, it can just be **reset**
- Good for testing compatability of software with different operating systems, as they can be run through a VM

#### Running incompatible software
- Sometimes programs are specific to a particular OS
- The OS can be run through a VM instead, which **saves money/time** as extra hardware doesn't need to be used
