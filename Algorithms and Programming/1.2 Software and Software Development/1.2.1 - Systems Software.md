## Section (a)

### Operating systems
- A collection of **programs** which work together to provide and **interface** between a **computer** and **user**
- Allow for a user to communicate with **hardware**

#### Popular operating systems
- Windows - most commonly used
- Linux / UNIX - used a lot by developers and in servers
- iOS - Apple OS for mobile devices
- Android
- Mac OS
- *Temple OS*

#### Requirements of an OS

##### Process management
- Programs and I/O devices **compete** for uses of resources
- The OS needs to **manage** which programs get access to which resources
- This can be done with [[#Scheduling|scheduling]]

##### Handling interrupts
- There are some **high-priority** processes, such as user inputs, which need to be **prioritised over other tasks**
- The OS needs to be able to handle [[#Interrupts|interrupts]]

##### Managing memory
- The OS needs to keep track of which parts of memory have been **allocated** and are being **used**
- This is important as programs can't **interfere** with each other's memory
- This is covered further in [[#Memory management|memory management]]

##### Input / Output
- This is done by using [[#Drivers|device drivers]]

### Types of operating system

#### Distributed OS
- Used in **servers**
- Able to **coordinate** and **spread** the processing of a single job across **multiple** computers
- Can be used for **task distribution** and **load balancing**

#### Multi-tasking OS
- A single processor *appears* to be able to do **more than 1** task **simultaneously**
- This is achieved through **scheduling**

#### Multi-user OS
- Some systems have a very powerful central computer called a **mainframe**
- Supports **multiple users**, which includes features for **security** and **privacy**
- Needs to efficiently manage **resource allocation**, which is done through **scheduling algorithms**
- This prevents **processor starvation**, which is when a process is not given enough processor time to be completed

#### Embedded OS
- Built to perform a **specific task**
- Much more limited **functionality**
- Typically have **lower power consumption**
- Applications are typically stored in **ROM**, which is fine as:
	- They probably *don't* need to be updated
	- ROM has a **faster** access speed than **secondary storage**

#### Real time OS
- Must respond within a **guaranteed time frame** to inputs
- Generally have **limited input**
- Must have a **failsafe**, so hardware **redundancy** (more sensors for example) is good 
- Failsafes are features which attempt to **minimise further damage** in the event of failure of some feature
- Examples:
	- Nuclear power plant
	- Self-driving cars
	- Industrial plant
	- On a plane

## Section (f)

### BIOS
- BIOS stands for **basic input output system**
- It is the **first** program which runs when a computer is switched on
- BIOS:
	- **Initialises** and **tests** hardware in a **POST (power on self test)** 
	- This includes testing whether **memory** is accessible and scanning **buses** 
	- Loads the **OS kernel** into **RAM**

## Section (g)

### Drivers
- Device drivers are **software** which allow the **OS** to control **peripherals**
- Note that drivers are **specific** to an **OS**
- There can be drivers for:
	- Printers
	- Displays
	- Keyboards
	- Mouses
- A lot of device drivers are *built in* to the OS
- Also look at [[1.1.3 Input, Output and Storage#Some terminology|this bit on drivers]]
