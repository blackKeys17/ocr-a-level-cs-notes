## Section (a)

### Programming paradigms
- **Paradigms** in programming are different ways to use a programming language to approach a problem, or different ways of thinking about programming
- They are split into 2 main categories - **imperative** and **declarative**
- Some paradigms may be **better-suited** towards some problems than others - this is one of the reasons why having a lot of different paradigms and programming languages is important

#### Imperative
- The code **clearly specifies the actions to be performed** through sets of instructions

##### Procedural
- This is probably the most widely used paradigm
- Relatively easy to write and interpret
- Uses **sequences** of instructions which are carried out **step by step**
- Some sequences of instructions may be nested in **procedures**
- More covered in [[#Procedural languages]]

##### Object-Oriented (OOP)
- Very suitable for problems which involve a lot of **reusable components**, which can be represented as **classes**
- Uses **classes**, which are like *blueprints* which can be used to create **objects**
- Classes can have **attributes** and **methods**, and by structuring code in this way, lots of code can be reused and maintained more easily
- There will be more in [[#Object-oriented languages]]

#### Declarative
- Focus on **defining or stating** the desired result rather than worrying about **how** it is achieved
- This is an **abstraction** from the user - they don't need to know how everything is implemented to use it

##### Functional
- Everything is treated as a function, including data
- Functions can be passed into other functions
- Very closely linked to maths (category theory?)

##### Logic
- Uses code which defines a **set of facts and rules** based on the problem
- **Queries** can be used to find answers to problems
- Doesn't really come up in a level

## Section (b)

### Procedural languages
- Usually the simplest to implement, so very widely used
- However, may not be the most efficient
- Uses traditional **data types** such as:
	- Integers
	- Floats
	- *Strings*
- Uses data structures such as:
	- Arrays
	- Lists
	- Hash tables

- **Structured programming** is a subsection of procedural programming where control flow is given by 4 main structures:
	- **Sequence** - code is executed **line by line**
	- **Selection** - using conditions such as **if** to only run code when that condition is met
	- **Iteration** - a block of code is **repeatedly** executed while a certain condition is met
	- **Recursion** - a function **calling itself**
- Procedural programming is suited to problems which can be expressed using these structures

## Section (c)

### Assembly language
- **Low level**, the *next level up* from machine code
- An **assembler** is used to translate assembly into machine code
- Uses **mnemonics** instead of binary like in machine code
- Commands in assembly are **processor-specific** - assembly can directly interact with registers in the CPU
- Direct control over hardware can be useful in **embedded systems**, which has been covered in another section
- Check [[1.2.2 - Applications Generation#Assemblers|this section on assemblers]]

#### Little man computer (LMC)
- A simplified model/simulation of a Von Neumann architecture computer which is used to teach students
- There is an online simulator for it [here](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/), which is very good for practising

## Section (d)

### Modes of addressing memory
- An instruction in machine code/assembly is split into 2 parts, the **opcode** and **operand**
- The opcode describes the **instruction** which is to be carried out, the operand is the **data** which the instruction is actually performed on
- A lot of the instructions above require memory to be accessed or addressed
- There are a few ways of addressing memory...

#### Immediate addressing
- This is where the value of the operand is the **actual value** which is used in the instruction
- For example, ADD 5 with immediate addressing will add the number 5 to ACC

#### Direct addressing
- This is where the operand is the **memory location** of the value which is going to be used in the instruction
- For example, ADD 5 with direct addressing will add the value of whatever is stored in memory location 5 to ACC
- This is used in LMC

#### Indirect addressing
- This is where the operand holds the **memory location of another memory location** which contains the value which is going to be used
- For example, ADD 5 with indirect addressing will find the value of whatever is stored in memory location 5, then jump to that memory location to get the value to be added to ACC
- This may seem redundant, but this can be useful when an operand is **too small to store the addresses** of every memory location

#### Indexed addressing
- The **index register (IR)** is involved with indexed addressing
- The address of the value to be used is formed by **adding the operand to the value stored in the IR**
