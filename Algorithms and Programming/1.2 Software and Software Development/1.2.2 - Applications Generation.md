## Section (a)

### Nature of applications

#### Applications software
- Used by an end user to perform a **specific task**
- *Requires* systems software to run
- Can be **bespoke**
	- Written to a specification
	- **Specific** to a customer
- Or could be **off the shelf**
	- Ready to buy, not usually as customisable

##### Examples
- Desktop publishing
	- Microsoft Publisher
	- Could be used to design leaflets
- Word processing
	- Microsoft Word
	- Could be used for letters or emails
- Spreadsheet software
	- Microsoft Excel
	- 1 use is in tracking finances
- Presentation software
	- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Web browsers
	- Edge, Chrome, Firefox

#### Systems software
- **Low-level** software which is responsible for **interacting with hardware** and providing a platform for application software to run on
- These include [[#Utilities|utilities]]

##### Examples
- Library programs
- Utility programs
- Operating system
- Device drivers

## Section (b)

### Utilities
- System software ensuring the **consistent**, **high performance** of the operating system
- In other words, utility software **maintains** the OS

#### Defragmentation
- Files may have to be split into **discontiguous chunks** when being stored on a HDD which will be in **physically separated** locations
- This **increases read times** as the read arm has to constantly move around different areas of storage
- Defragmentation software attempts to group together these chunks to **improve read times**

#### File management
- This could be a **GUI** for interacting with files, which is easier to use than a **command line interface**
- Could provide easier ways to **copy, move and delete** files

#### Compression
- Compression is very important for **transmitting data**
- Compressed files which have been downloaded also need to be **decompressed**

#### Automatic updates
- Ensures OS is up to date
- Updates might be automatically installed when the computer is **restarted**
- This is important, especially for **security** and **fixing bugs**

#### Backup
- Creates **copies** of specific files, usually in fixed time intervals
- This could also mean file synchronisation with a cloud service, which is becoming increasingly common

## Section (c)

### Open source vs closed source
- **Source code** refers to object code *before* it has been compiled
- Programs can be easily reconstructed and analysed if their source code is given
- However, the converse isn't true - given compiled code, it is very difficult to construct the source code

#### Open source
- Source code is **openly available**
- Anybody can use the software **free of charge**
- Developers can develop derivatives of open source software, but these are also required to be open source

#### Closed source
- Source code is not publicly available
- Users need to hold an appropriate **license**

#### Comparison

| Open source                                                                     | Closed source                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can be used by anyone *without* a license, distributed **with the source code** | **Requires license** to use, source code can't be accessed as company **owns the copyright license** |
| Can be modified and improved by anyone, so its *more* secure a lot of the time  | Can also be highly secure as closed source software is usually developed profesionally               |
| Can be modified and sold on                                                     | Users can't modify or improve the software                                                           |
| May have insufficient support from online                                       | Usually very thorough and detailed documentation                                                     |
- Deciding on which approach to take depends on **timescale**, **budget** and **functionality**

## Section (d)

### Translators
- Computers execute **machine code**
- Each processor has its own instruction set so machine code is **hardware specific**
- It is very **difficult** for humans to **read**, **write** and **debug** machine code
- Instead, humans mainly write in **high level** code, which is a lot easier for us to **use** and **debug** 

#### Assemblers
- Assembly is a **low level** language
- It is used for:
	- Embedded machines
	- Highly optimised code
	- Providing direct control over hardware
	
- Assembly gets translated directly into machine code by the **assembler**, so it is also **hardware specific**
- Uses **mnemonics**
- **1 line of assembly is equivalent to 1 line of machine code** (pretty much all the time for a level)

#### Compilers
- Translates high level code into machine code
- The entire code file is compiled into an **executable**
- This means that the executable can be run multiple times without having to be interpreted each time
- This means that it will run **faster**, but it **takes more time** to compile once
- It is **harder** to **locate errors** in compiled programs
- Code can be run *without* a translator - only the executable file is needed

##### Examples
- C
- C++
- Java
- Rust

#### Interpreters
- Also translates high level code into machine code
- This is done **line-by-line**
- Interpreters stop if a line contains an error, which allows for errors to be **more easily located**
- They *don't* have the initial wait which a compiler has when compiling the code, but interpreters are generally **slower** as **code must be translated each time it is executed**
- Interpreted code **requires and interpreter** to run on differnet devices
- This could actually make it *more* portable than compiled code, as the same code can be used with platform-specific interpreters instead
- There are ways for compilers to get around this portability issues, the **JVM** for Java being a good example

##### Examples
- Python
- JavaScript

## Section (e)

### Stages of compilation
- There are multiple stages of compilation which high level code needs to go through to get translated into an executable

#### Lexical analysis
- 

#### Syntax analysis
- 

##### Semantic analysis (not covered for a level)

#### Optimisation
- 

## Section (f)

### Linkers

#### Static linkers

#### Dynamic linkers

### Loaders
