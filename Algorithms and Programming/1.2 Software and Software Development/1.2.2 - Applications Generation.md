## Section (a)

### Nature of applications

#### Applications software
- 

#### Systems software
- **Low-level** software which is responsible for **interacting with hardware** and providing a platform for application software to run on

## Section (b)

### Utilities
- System software ensuring the **consistent**, **high performance** of the operating system
- In other words, utility software **maintains** the OS

#### Defragmentation
- Large files stored on a **hard disk drive** may be split up in several different **physical locations**
- Defragmentation software **groups together** parts of a file so they are stored **contiguously**, which makes **read times** faster

## Section (c)

## Section (d)

### Translators
- Computers execute **machine code**
- It is very **difficult** for humans to **read**, **write** and **debug** machine code
- Each processor has its own instruction set so machine code is **hardware specific**

#### Assemblers
- Assembly is a **low level** language
- Assembly gets translated directly into machine code by the **assembler**, so it is also **hardware specific**

#### Compilers
- Translates high level code into machine code
- The entire code file is compiled into an **executable**
- This means that the executable can be run multiple times without having to be interpreted each time
- This means that it will run **faster**, but it **takes more time** to compile once
- It is **harder** to **locate errors** in compiled programs

#### Interpreters
- Also translates high level code into machine code
