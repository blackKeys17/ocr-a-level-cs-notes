## Section (a)

### Some terminology:
- Hardware - **physical** parts of a computer system
- Peripherals - devices which **aren't*** built into a computer
- Input device - **Peripheral** which is used to **input** information into a computer
- Output device - **Peripheral** which is used to **output** information from a computer
- Device driver - **Software** which allows for the **communication** between the **OS** and **peripherals**
- Human computer interaction - Studying **input** and **output** devices

### Input devices

#### Keyboards
- Used to enter **text** into a computer
- Different **layouts**:
	- QWERTY
	- DVORAK
- **Numeric** keypads to **simplify** input
- Musical **keyboards** for **MIDI** input
- Accessible keyboards - could be more **ergonomic** for less strain on the hands, could have **larger letters** for people who are **visually impaired**

#### Pointing devices
- Translates **physical movements** into **data** which can be processed an used to control something like a **cursor**
- This is most commonly a **mouse**
- Could be a **touchpad** or **tablet**
- Graphics tablet uses a **stylus**, giving much more **control**, making it good for **graphic design**

#### Barcode readers
- Barcodes have bars with different **widths**, which correspond to different **numbers**
- They use **check digits** as a countermeasure against physical damage
- A **laser** is used to read in the barcode, which can be done very **quickly**
- **QR (quick response)** codes are more popular nowadays, they are capable of storing **more information**  

#### Image capture
- **Scanners**
	- Convert a document into pixels
	- Allows for documents to be transported digitally

- **Video capture**
	- Screen recording
	- Can be used for streaming

- **Digital cameras**
	- Images stored electronically
	- Can be uploaded to a computer

#### Sensors
- **Microphones** can be used for sound inputs
- **Altimeters** for measuring altitude
- **Accelerometers** for acceleration
- **Gyroscopes** for orientation
- **Temperature** and **humidity** sensors

### Output devices

#### Monitors and touchscreens
- **Monitors** can be **coloured** or **monochrome**
- They are usually interacted with by using a **keyboard** and **mouse**
- **Touchscreens** are generally easier to use
- They can be considered an **input** device as well

#### Printers

##### Dot matrix
- Pins strike the surface of the paper
- **Slow**, **poor quality** images
- **Cheaper**, so good for printing receipts

##### Ink jet
- Sprays ink onto the paper through very small holes
- Ink needs to be replaced often, **expensive**
- Printing is **slower**
- Usually used for high quality images

##### Laser
- Powdered ink is fused onto paper by heat
- Much **faster** than previous methods
- Initial cost of printer is **expensive**, *but* ink lasts much longer, so becomes **cheaper over time** than an ink jet printer
- Good for offices and schools

#### Speakers
- Outputs sound from a computer
- Can be used by **multimedia** software

#### Actuators
- Able to perform **precise movements**
- Uses a digital signal to control movements

## Section (b)

### Storage
- Storage is **non-volatile**, unalike RAM, which *is volatile
- These storage media are considered to be **secondary storage**
	- This means that they doesn't lose any data which is stored even if its power is cut off
- There are multiple factors to consider when choosing a type of storage for a specific purpose

#### Magnetic storage
- Stores bits through **magnetic polarisation** of small portions of magnetic material
	- Here, 1s and 0s can be stored through polarised and unpolarised regions
- These can be read from a **read-write head**, which is able to detect changes in polarisation

##### Examples
- Hard disk drives (HDDs)
	- Store data on magnetic platters
	- To read data, the platters are rotated underneath an arm which allows for read/write access to any part of the plate

- Tape storage
	- Magnetic substance deposited on a pistic tape
	- Slow read times, but large capacity, so usually used for backups
	
- Floppy disks
	- Thin magnetic disk encased in plastic
	- Very portable and lightweight, so useful for exchanging small amounts of data

#### Optical storage
- **Discs** are coated in a reflective coating
- Different parts of the disc are either **reflective (lands)** or **non-reflective (pits)**
- These regions are used to encode binary digits
- Discs can be read from with a **laser**, which is reflected by lands and not reflected by pits

##### Examples
- CDs (compact disc)
	- Small, thin and light discs
	- Most commonly used for audio files

- DVDs (digital versatile disc)
	- Higher storage capacity than CDs
	- Usually used to store videos, which require **more storage space**

- Blu-Ray
	- Similar to DVDs but with much more storage
	- Good for storing high-resolution films

#### Solid state storage
- Stores bits by trapping electrons within circuitry in a microchip

##### Examples
- Solid state drives (SSD)
- USB sticks and memory sticks

#### Comparison
- These are *generalisations*, and don't apply to everything

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Speed (read/write)**              | Quite slow                                    | Quite slow                  | Fast                            |
| **Storage space**                   | Large                                         | Quite small                 | Varies, but usually quite small |
| **Moving parts**                    | Has moving parts                              | Has moving parts            | Doesn't have moving parts       |
| **Cost (per unit data )**           | Generally quite cheap                         | Generally quite cheap       | More expensive                  |
| **Portability**                     | Not as portable                               | Very light and portable     | Very light and portable         |
| **Robustness (resistance to wear)** | Can be damaged if dropped or by magnetisation | Can be damaged by scratches | More physically robust          |

## Section (c)

### RAM and ROM
- These are both examples of **primary storage**, as opposed to the **secondary storage** mentioned earlier

#### RAM
- RAM stands for **random access memory**
- It can be accessed **fast** and memory locations can be accessed **randomly** (as opposed to **sequentially** in media such as HDDs)
- More **expensive** than storage
- **Volatile**, meaning that it loses its information when power is cut off
- Used to store **instructions** and **data** of programs which are currently running

#### ROM
- ROM stands for **read-only memory**
- As the name suggests, it **can't be modified**
- ROM is **non-volatile**
- Used to store **fixed** sequences of instructions such as **BIOS**

## Section (d)

### Virtual storage
- Not to be confused with [[1.2.1 - Systems Software#Virtual memory|virtual memory]]
- This is a general term given to storing information **remotely**

#### Cloud storage
- Cloud storage is a good example
- The storage process is **abstracted** from the user
	- The data being stored might be spread out across multiple servers around the world
	- They could be located in physically separated storages
	- This doesn't matter to the user, which can treat the data as being stored in 1 area
	
- This allows for uploaded files to be accessed from **anywhere** provided that there is an internet connection
- It is more **convenient** but could potentially be **expensive**
