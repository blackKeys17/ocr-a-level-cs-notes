## Section (a)

### Some terminology:
- Hardware - **physical** parts of a computer system
- Peripherals - devices which **aren't*** built into a computer
- Input device - **Peripheral** which is used to **input** information into a computer
- Output device - **Peripheral** which is used to **output** information from a computer
- Device driver - **Software** which allows for the **communication** between the **OS** and **peripherals**
- Human computer interaction - Studying **input** and **output** devices

### Input devices

#### Keyboards
- Used to enter **text** into a computer
- Different **layouts**:
	- QWERTY
	- DVORAK
- **Numeric** keypads to **simplify** input
- Musical **keyboards** for **MIDI** input
- Accessible keyboards - could be more **ergonomic** for less strain on the hands, could have **larger letters** for people who are **visually impaired**

#### Pointing devices
- Translates **physical movements** into **data** which can be processed an used to control something like a **cursor**
- This is most commonly a **mouse**
- Could be a **touchpad** or **tablet**
- Graphics tablet uses a **stylus**, giving much more **control**, making it good for **graphic design**

#### Barcode readers
- Barcodes have bars with different **widths**, which correspond to different **numbers**
- They use **check digits** as a countermeasure against physical damage
- A **laser** is used to read in the barcode, which can be done very **quickly**
- **QR (quick response)** codes are more popular nowadays, they are capable of storing **more information**  

#### Image capture
- **Scanners**
	- Convert a document into pixels
	- Allows for documents to be transported digitally

- **Video capture**
	- Screen recording
	- Can be used for streaming

- **Digital cameras**
	- Images stored electronically
	- Can be uploaded to a computer

#### Sensors
- **Microphones** can be used for sound inputs
- **Altimeters** for measuring altitude
- **Accelerometers** for acceleration
- **Gyroscopes** for orientation
- **Temperature** and **humidity** sensors

### Output devices

#### Monitors and touchscreens
- **Monitors** can be **coloured** or **monochrome**
- They are usually interacted with by using a **keyboard** and **mouse**
- **Touchscreens** are generally easier to use
- They can be considered an **input** device as well

#### Printers

##### Dot matrix
- Pins strike the surface of the paper
- **Slow**, **poor quality** images
- **Cheaper**, so good for printing receipts

##### Ink jet
- Sprays ink onto the paper through very small holes
- Ink needs to be replaced often, **expensive**
- Printing is **slower**
- Usually used for high quality images

##### Laser
- Powdered ink is fused onto paper by heat
- Much **faster** than previous methods
- Initial cost of printer is **expensive**, *but* ink lasts much longer, so becomes **cheaper over time** than an ink jet printer
- Good for offices and schools

#### Speakers
- Outputs sound from a computer

#### Actuators
- Able to perform **precise movements**
- Uses a digital signal to control movements
