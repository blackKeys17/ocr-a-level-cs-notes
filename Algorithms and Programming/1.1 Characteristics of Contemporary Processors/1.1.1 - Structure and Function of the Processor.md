## Section (a)

### ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)
- Computes all **arithmetic** and **logical** operations
- Has specialised circuitry to carry out these operations
- Arithmetic operations include:
	- Addition, subtraction
	- Integer division, mod operator
	- Can be on fixed point or floating point
- Logical operations include:
	- Boolean logic
	- AND, OR, NOT, XOR

### Control Unit
- Component within the **CPU**
- Directs the operations of the **CPU**
- It has the following jobs:
	- Controlling and coordinating the activities of the CPU
	- Managing flow of data between CPU and other devices
	- Accepting the next instruction
	- **Decoding** instructions
	- **Storing** resulting data back in memory
- Contains the PC and CIR (shown below)

### Registers
- **High-speed** and **small** memory cells
- Used to **temporarily** store data for a **specialised** purpose

| Register                               | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Program Counter **(PC)**               | Stores address of next instruction to be executed                                                                                                                            |
| Accumulator **(ACC)**                  | Stores results from calculations                                                                                                                                             |
| Memory Address Register **(MAR)**      | Stores address of a location which is to be read from or written to, connected to address bus                                                                                |
| Memory Data Register **(MDR)**         | Temporarily stores data which has been read or needs to be written, connected to data bus                                                                                    |
| Current Instruction Register **(CIR)** | Stores the current instruction, which can be split into opcode and operand, needed as some instructions such as those which involve writing require MDR to be used again<br> |

### Buses
- Buses are just a set of **parallel wires** which connect 2 or more components within the CPU
- There are 3 buses within a CPU, the **data bus**, **control bus** and **address bus**, which are known as the **system bus** together
#### Data bus
- **Bidirectional**
- Transports **data** and **instructions** between components
#### Address bus
- **Unidirectional** (others are bidirectional)
- Transmits **memory addresses** specifying where data is to be *read* from or *written* to
#### Control Bus
- **Bidirectional**
- Transmits **control signals** between components
- These can include:
	- Read/write signals
	- Bus request/grant for the data bus
	- Clock signals
	- Interrupt requests

## Section (b)

### Pipelining
- Completing the fetch, decode and execute cycles of **separate** instructions **simultaneously**
- Appropriate data can be held in a **buffer** which can be accessed quickly
- For example, whilst an instruction is being decoded, another instruction can be fetched
- **This reduces the amount of CPU which is kept idle**, which is how it speeds up the running of programs
- However, a pipeline might need to be **flushed** if a conditional **jump** instruction is received
- This means that pipelining is most effective in *linear* programs, where there aren't as many **jump** instructions

### FDE (Fetch-Decode-Execute) Cycle

#### Fetch phase
- Address from **PC** is copied into the **MAR**
- Address from **MAR** sent down address bus along with read signal down control bus to **RAM**
- Instruction at the address specified copied into the **MDR**, **PC** gets incremented by 1
- Instruction in **MDR** is copied to **CIR**
#### Decode Phase
- Instruction from **CIR** is split into **opcode** and **operand**
- The **opcode** tells the processor *what to do*, and the **operand** is the data which get *acted upon*
#### Execute Phase
- Decoded instruction gets executed, for some specific instructions:
##### Jump
- Operand copied into the **PC**, then next fetch stage starts
##### Load
- Operand passed into **MDR**
- Value at **MDR** then passed into **ACC**
##### Load from memory
- Operand passed into **MAR**
- Value from memory address passed into **MDR**
- Value from **MDR** copied into **ACC**
##### Add
- Copy operand into **MDR**
- Values in **ACC** and **MDR** passed into **ALU**
- New value stored in **ACC**
##### Add from memory
- Copy operand into **MAR**
- Copy value from memory address into **MDR**
- Pass values from **ACC** and **MDR** into **ALU**
- New value stored in **ACC**
- ***Subtraction is basically the same***
##### Store
- Copy operand into **MAR**
- Value in **ACC** copied into **MDR**
- Written to memory with the address bus, data bus and **write signal** from control bus
##### Output
- Value from **ACC** passed into **I/O** device, outputted
##### Output from memory
- Operand copied into **MAR**
- Value from memory address copied into **MDR**
- Value passed from  **MDR** into **ACC**
- Value passed from **ACC** to **I/O** device and outputted

## Section (c)

### Factors affecting CPU performance
- Always just these 3 whenever its an exam question
#### Clock speed
- Determined by an internal **clock signal**, typically measured in *gigahertz* for modern processors 
- In a **fixed period of time**, a higher clock speed allows for more **FDE cycles** to be completed, which clearly increases the **number of instructions** which can be **executed**
#### Cache size
- There is a **delay** known as **latency** when reading from main memory, which means the CPU might need to **wait** for data to be received
- Cache is a **high-speed** memory which has different circuitry to **RAM**
- **Frequently used** instructions can be stored in cache to be **accessed faster**
#### Number of cores
- **Multicore** processors contain distinct **CPU cores** which can execute instructions individually
- This means that **multiple** FDE cycles can be carried out simultaneously, which should theoretically increase its performance
- In practice, some problems aren't able to utilise multiple cores efficiently

## Section (d)
- Covered earlier - [[#Pipelining]] 

## Section (e)

### Von Neumann architecture
- **Shared memory** for both data and instructions
- Instructions are fetched from memory before being processed
- Contains **specialised registers**
- **Single set of buses**, can't read/write **simultaneously** 
- Inputs and output devices
- **Cheaper to develop** as control unit is easier to design
- Programs can be **optimised in size**

### Harvard architecture
- **Separate memory** for data and instructions
- **Separate sets of buses**
- Instruction and data can be fetched **simultaneously**
- Memory **types** can be **different**):
	- Instructions can be stored with **read-only** memory
	- Data can be stored with **read-write** access
- Can **optimise** the size of buses/memory to make more efficient use of space
